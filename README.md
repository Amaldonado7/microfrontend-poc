# Microfrontend-poc

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. Here you will have 3 different apps built in React. Each of these apps work separately. It is used with modular federation which allows a JavaScript application to dynamically run code from another bundle/build, on client and server.

# Usage

```
# Install dependencies in app1, app 2 and container folder
npm install
```

```
# Run each app
npm run start
```
